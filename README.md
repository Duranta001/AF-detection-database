# AF-detection-database
Here, two datasets of single-led ECG signals of AF detection are stored. These two datasets are modified datasets from two other datasets which are collected from the Mendeley data website and the Physionet website.  The first dataset was collected from the Mendeley data website and it contains 411 single lead ECG signals which are classified into two classes (Normal sinusoidal signal and AF signal). The second one was collected from the Physionet database (â€˜The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017). This dataset contains 1719 single lead ECG signals which are separated into two classes (normal and AF). The dataset will be uploaded after the acceptance of this manuscript.
